"# D-Destiny-Slot-Machine" 
#The code in this zip is a small Godot project I coded for my players. I wanted to give out an app that'd let them roll new weaponry on a slot machine, this is that.
#The chances for item drops are determined by a d20 roll and ar labeled as such:
* Whites: 1 - 7
* Greens: 8 - 14
* Blues: 15 - 18
* Purples: 18 - 20
* Yellows: 20 and must succeed on a coin flip
#There is also code for additional features like a proficiency bonus, I may create a second program with new features if I feel it neccessary.
